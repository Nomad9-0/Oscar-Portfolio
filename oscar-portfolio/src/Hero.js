            <p>I began teaching myself web-developing skills in late 2016 and began taking on freelancing jobs in late 2017. My constant drive to learn new skills fit perfectly with programming. I love learning and perfecting my craft. I decided to join the UCLA Coding Bootcamp to expand my skills with front and back end web-development. I look forward to working on projects where I can, not only apply my skills, but also continue growing as a developer.

            For fun, I play video games, board games, Dungeons & Dragons, and adventure outdoors. I challenge my self physically by competing in obstacle course races such as Spartan Races, going on long difficult hikes, mountain biking, and boxing. I love to read and learn from people who inspire me. Some of my favorite books are Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferris. I have been described by friends as motivating because I never give up and donâ€™t let them give up on goals and challenges set in front of us.
