            <p>
                After College I worked as an analyst for Johnson & Johnson traveling all over the USA and coming up with business strategies to increase revenue and inventory turnover. 
                I lead a team of 18 professionals and designed and implemented strategies and methods to meet our goals. 
                It is here where I was introduced to programming and began my journey to become a Full Stack Developer.

                I began teaching myself web-developing skills in late 2016 and began taking on freelancing jobs in late 2017. 
                Since then I have help business improve their SEO and collaborate on business strategies to pursue while providing them with my skill set. 
                I love learning and perfecting my craft. I decided to join the UCLA Coding Bootcamp to expand my skills with front and back end web-development. 
                I look forward to working on projects where I can, not only apply my skills, but also continue growing as a developer.

                For fun, I play video games, board games, Dungeons & Dragons, and adventure outdoors. 
                I challenge my self physically by competing in obstacle course races such as Spartan Races, going on long difficult hikes, Jiu-Jitsu, and Boxing. 
                I love to read and learn from people who inspire me. Some of my favorite books are Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferris. 
                I have been described by friends as motivating because I never give up and donâ€™t let them give up on goals and challenges set in front of us.
